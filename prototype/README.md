| fizzbuzz.js  | Simple JS representation of what I was trying to achieve |
| fizzbuzz.lol | The LOLCODE version of the JS file                       |

Testing the output from fizzbuzz.lol identified two problems:

 * The loop starts at zero
 * The output ends with a blank line

The updated version in the root directory addresses both of these.
